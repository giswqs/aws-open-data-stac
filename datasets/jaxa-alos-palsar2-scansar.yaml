Name: PALSAR-2 ScanSAR CARD4L (L2.2)
Description: |
  The 25 m PALSAR-2 ScanSAR is normalized backscatter data of PALSAR-2 broad area observation mode with observation width of 350 km.
    The SAR imagery was ortho-rectificatied and slope corrected using the ALOS World 3D - 30 m (AW3D30) Digital Surface Model.
    Polarization data are stored as 16-bit digital numbers (DN).
    The DN values can be converted to gamma naught values in decibel unit (dB) using the following equation:
    Î³0 = 10*log10(DN2) - 83.0 dB
    CARD4L stands for CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (Level 2.2) data are ortho-rectified and radiometrically terrain-corrected.
    This dataset is compatible with the [Committee on Earth Observation (CEOS)](https://ceos.org/) [Analysis Ready Data for LAND (CARD4L)](https://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/NRB/v5.5/CARD4L-PFS_NRB_v5.5.pdf) standard.<br/><br/>
    
    Also included are 2022 & 2023 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR L1.1 and L2.1 datasets for regions in Turkey and 
    Syria impacted by the magnitude 7.8 [earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake) that occurred on February 6, 2023. L1.1 is range and single look azimuth compressed data represented by complex I and Q channels to preserve the magnitude and phase 
    information. Range coordinate is in slant range. In the case of ScanSAR mode, an image file is generated per each scan. Level 2.1 data is 
    orthorectified from level 1.1 data by using digital elevation model. Pixel spacing is selectable depending on observation modes. Image 
    coordinate in map projection is geocoded.
