# aws-open-data-stac

The list of STAC endpoints for the [AWS Open Data Program](https://registry.opendata.aws/). The AWS Open Data Program hosts a lot of [geospatial datasets](https://bit.ly/3V4XKHh). However, not all of them are available as STAC catalogs. This repository provides a list of STAC endpoints for the datasets that are available as STAC catalogs, i.e., any dataset that has a `stac` tag in its [metadata](https://registry.opendata.aws/?search=tags:stac).
